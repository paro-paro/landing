Last April, we sent the first container of our coffee to China for the first time, and very soon, in October of the same year, the Chinese market received the second shipment of coffee, and now we are working to send the third one.

With two shipments materialized at the expense of continuing with a third, we want to highlight the importance of opening and consolidating international markets. We take on a complicated logistics operation with great pleasure and motivation because it enables the excellence of our farmers' product to be valued in its fair measure and acquire prices significantly higher than local sales where until now they were limited.

With these actions, we could also provide more resources and break the poverty cycle that grips them. Half of the mutual benefit of these actions directly impacts them. In this way, we want to value the work done by the weakest link in the distribution chain and contribute to its socio-economic development. This is something that would not be possible without the involvement and support of the entire Ethichubers community. The journey covers the distance from the remote rural areas where our farmers produce their coffee to Nansha's port in China.

We take the opportunity to congratulate the crew of the MAERSK SANTANA vessel for providing such a great job. Until now, there had been no incidence. We do not forget the members of the Maersk Yangtze ship. They have transported some 15 tons of Mexican coffee in their warehouses, including EthiHub farmers - with its first destination to the port of Vancouver in Canada, for further transfer to Calgary.

We are happy and proud of our collaborations. And at this point, we also want to thank our RWTC partners for the outstanding work done by their exceptional team.

They have received us with open arms, and they have been aware of our social company goal from the day first. They have provided us with numerous graphic materials that we share with all of you.

We will keep you informed!
