## The key role of small farmers in the world

It may shock you to know that **a third of the world’s food is produced by small farmers living in poverty**. They work very hard but having no access to finance prevents them from thriving, with **severe consequences for the whole planet: poverty, migration, deforestation**. It is paramount to implement disruptive solutions because **agriculture is key to climate change.**

## EthicHub: Connecting people for Regenerative Agriculture

Since 2018, EthicHub has been **connecting people to harvest regenerative wealth**, enabling smallholder farmers to improve their living standard through their own productivity by providing them access to affordable finance and added value markets **thanks to their interaction with global impact investors like you!**

## Partnership with Heifer International to transform financial access

In 2023 we proudly partnered with **Heifer International, Heifer Mexico and Heifer Labs** to improve financial access for smallholder coffee farmers in Mexico through the **EthicHub Regenerative Finance (ReFi) platform.**

### Positive results from the collaboration with Heifer Mexico

Now we are excited to share that **60\_Decibels**, a leading impact measurement consultancy, has released its report on our collaboration with **Heifer Mexico**, and the results couldn’t be more positive.

## A Real and transformative impact on farmers' lives

**The key highlight** of the [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w7xDAv5fjTQbA5mv-nsb8nB_vlucUNxP/view?usp=sharing) is that **all respondents stated that without the support of EthicHub and Heifer, they would have no other financing alternatives**. This finding not only fills us with pride but also confirms that we are achieving one of our most important goals: **reaching underserved segments** and creating a real, transformative impact in their lives.

This result demonstrates that we are making a **significant difference** by providing financing opportunities **to rural communities that have historically been excluded** from traditional financial systems. And that’s exactly what drives us to continue with even more strength and commitment!

## A fairer and more inclusive future for small farmers

We are incredibly grateful for the trust of these communities and for the excellent collaboration with **Heifer International**, who, together with **EthicHub,** continue to be a bridge toward a fairer, more inclusive future for smallholder farmers.

Thank you also to everyone who took part in this survey with our **research partner 60\_Decibels.** Thank you to Gerardo Albores, Alejandro Jarquin, Lucía Ruíz and the entire Heifer Mexico and EthicHub teams for their support throughout the project. This work was generously sponsored by Heifer International.
