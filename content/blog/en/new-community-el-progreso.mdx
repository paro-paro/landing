The El Progreso community's first [project is now available](https://app.ethichub.com/projects) on the platform, ready to be financed and generate a notable social impact.

The small coffee growers of El Progreso join EthicHub to access new financing tools, much cheaper and more accessible, and have the opportunity to send their coffee to international markets.

With the incorporation of El Progreso, **now count 15 communities in the EthicHub family**. We love that our family is growing so fast. Little by little and together, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a sustainable ecosystem, where all the actors involved win with the relationship, generating mutual benefit. So welcome to EthicHub, and very proud to have you!

#### Here is excellent news that we want to share with the entire EthicHub community. And to welcome the El Progreso community and celebrate its incorporation, we will distribute an extra 1000 Ethix among all Ethixholders. Stay tuned to our RRSS!

Geographically, El Progreso's community is located on the slopes of the Tacaná Volcano, in the municipality of Cacahoatán, and is submerged between the mountains of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. Mr. Cristian Edegar Bravo leads the El Progreso group. Like the rest of our farmers, **they are hard-working people, very committed to caring for their crops**, and extraordinarily respectful of nature and biodiversity.
