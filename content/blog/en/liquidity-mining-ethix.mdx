EthicHub, pioneer connecting DEFI with the impact economy, launches a Liquidity Mining program for Ethix, to boost financing for the unbanked small farmers.

Participants will benefit from a daily distribution of 1000 Ethix tokens and from generated commissions for tradings between Ether / Ethix pair.

Yield farming generates a passive return by immobilizing different crypto assets without losing exposure to them. Mining Liquidity adds a twist to it, allowing also to benefit from the incentive tokens from the platforms.

Both are just some of the alternatives offered by Blockchain technology and the huge possibilities Decentralized Finance (DEFI) currently offers. Anyone using open and decentralized protocols can participate in the numerous pools created for this purpose, providing liquidity by using tokens, making produce their assets by depositing them in Smart Contracts without a counterparty risk. A relatively simple operation, not recommended for newbies, which enables users to collect returns as pool members.

There are many decentralized protocols where Yield Farming can take place, being Uniswap the most important in the DeFi ecosystem with 3.6 billion dollars under the management of its Smart Contracts. This is precisely the platform EthicHub has chosen to launch its Liquidity Mining program.

Participants in EthicHub’s liquidity pool at Uniswap will benefit from a daily distribution of 1000 Ethix tokens in addition to the commissions generated on each trading of Ethix to Ether and vice versa, with the added satisfaction of supporting a token that generates a proven social impact.

Some people believe Liquidity mining programs are similar to ponzi schemes since in many projects, liquidity providers disappear the day after the ending of the program they won incentive tokens with, earning stratospheric but unsustainable returns.

The key point is the protocol’s design and how this liquidity injection provides added value to be consolidated in the long term. Compound or Yearn have been liquidity mining programs that can be considered tremendously successful, being able to exponentially scale these protocols liquidity and consolidate it in the long term by creating a users community who originally may only came through the liquidity program, but where many remained loyal.

EthicHub launched the Ethix by the end of December, and just a month and a half later its design has proven to be successful: up to date, staked Ethix at the compensation system are providing collateral to all the platform’s loans granted to farmers without guarantees, with a considerable safety margin. However, if too many defaults happen at once (in three years operating we keep a 0% default) because of an unexpected event, too many Ethix would have to be sold to compensate those who lent their money to the farmers and since Liquidity is still limited, the price would be greatly affected, jeopardizing the solvency of the compensation system.

This is why it is essential to increase its liquidity at Exchanges where Ethix are converted into other cryptocurrencies to consolidate the collateral of the compensation system so farmers’ loans can grow exponentially, which in turn creates demand for Ethix and consolidates the value contribution provided by the liquidity program.

In addition, for liquidity not to come just circumstantially in the short term, the liquidity program will last at least one year.

EthicHub farming program can be accessed at [ethix.ethichub.com/en](https://ethix.ethichub.com/en). Participants will be able to use Ethix they already have or they can buy them in Uniswap, Balancer or Bilaxy, as well as its equivalent amount in Ether (Ethereum blockchain cryptocurrency, leader in the DeFi ecosystem).

By contributing to the pool, users will receive tokens for their share of participation plus commissions generated each time someone wants to buy or sell Ethix using such a pool. To get the Liquidity mining program benefits, these tokens must be deposited in [ethix.ethichub.com](https://ethix.ethichub.com/) where they will remain as the last level of collateral (the first level of collateral is the Ethix of the credit originators in contact with farmers, the second level of collateral are the Ethix from the compensation pool that is born with 50% of all Ethix created, and the third level of collateral are the users who deposit their Ethix or Uniswap tokens in the compensation system.

Launching this program, EthicHub becomes pioneer in linking DEFI Farming with the real and impact economy of the hundreds of unbanked farmers working with EthicHub who now have access to new financing possibilities at much lower rates. This is what we call # farming4good
