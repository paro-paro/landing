## Launch of the new EthicHub platform version

We are very proud to announce that in a few weeks we will be launching the **new version of the EthicHub platform**, where you will find our old platforms of [Loans](https://app.ethichub.com/) ([app.ethichub.com](https://app.ethichub.com/)) and [Collateral](https://ethix.ethichub.com/) ([ethix.ethichub.com](https://ethix.ethichub.com/)) in a single integrated experience. This is a huge step for all of us and we want to make sure we explain how this change will bring significant benefits to the entire community.

## A pioneering bridge between investors and farmers

In 2018, we were pioneers building the first bridge on blockchain technology to unite investors and farmers in a mutually beneficial financial relationship, connecting complementary economic regions. And you were pioneers crossing this bridge for the first time!

## Innovation and technological evolution at EthicHub

More than six years have passed and over this time we have been implementing major improvements that have come with the advancement of technology, from stable cryptocurrencies to self-generated wallets.

### Technological advancements that have transformed the platform

Additionally, the introduction of our innovative Collective Collateral (Compensation System) opened up a new range of possibilities to support farming communities through mechanisms that were not possible before Smart Contracts existed.

All this evolution has meant a lot of learning and adjustments to our initial technological structure. That's why we decided to redesign it to improve its functionality and ability to scale.

## Key Improvements in the New Platform

The first thing you'll notice is that we've improved the language, using more descriptive words to make it easier to familiarize yourself with the platform's functions.

### How the New Platform facilitates investment in farming communities

We have also placed side by side the two main functions of EthicHub through which you can invest in agricultural communities: funding and guarantees. In this way, it is more evident to understand how the two are related and complementary.

We trust that these changes will serve to strengthen our wonderful relationship with you and the farmers, expanding our collective capacity to make an impact!

## Join the Ethichubber Community and be the first to learn about the changes

Doesn't that sound awesome? We'll be giving our Ethichubbers the first look. Sign up for our next September Coffee with Ethichubbers [here](https://www.ethichub.com/en/ethichub-2-0).

The time has come to scale our reach: Together we are demonstrating that new forms of economy centered on people can be built.

Thank you so much for being part of this journey!
