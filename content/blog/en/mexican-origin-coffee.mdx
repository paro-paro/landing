## The treasure of the Mexican mountains

Mexico has a rich coffee tradition dating back more than 200 years. The mountainous regions of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Veracruz offer ideal conditions for growing high-quality coffee.

### Unique conditions

- **Altitude**: Between 900 and 1,700 meters above sea level
- **Climate**: Moderate temperatures and well-distributed rainfall
- **Soil**: Rich in volcanic minerals

## From plant to cup

The specialty coffee production process is meticulous and requires dedication at every stage:

### Cultivation
Coffee plants grow under the shade of native trees, allowing for slow ripening and the development of complex flavors.

### Harvest
Picking is done by hand, selecting only beans at their optimal point of ripeness.

### Processing
Traditional wet processing highlights the fruity notes and bright acidity characteristic of Mexican coffee.

## The impact on communities

Beyond product quality, coffee represents the livelihood of thousands of families in rural areas of Mexico.

### Current challenges

Small producers face significant challenges:

1. **Climate change** altering rainfall patterns
2. **Price fluctuations** in the international market
3. **Limited access to financing**
4. **Aging** of plantations

## Fair trade coffee

The fair trade movement has been fundamental in improving conditions for producers. However, there is still much to be done.

Direct financing platforms, like EthicHub, allow investors to directly support coffee cooperatives, ensuring:

- Fair prices for producers
- Transparency in the supply chain
- Financing for improvements and certifications
