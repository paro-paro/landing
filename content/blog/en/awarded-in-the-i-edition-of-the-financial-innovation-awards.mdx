FinTech Innovation Summit launches, in this IV Edition, an initiative to point out and reward financial innovation in Spain... and we have been awarded!

The Financial Innovation Awards - FIA, promoted by Urban Event Marketing, establishes 5 categories where different projects compete to reach the award. These categories are: Most Innovative Bank, Leading FinTech Woman of the Year, Most Innovative Digital Platform, Most Disruptive FinTech and Highest Social/Sustainability Impact Initiative.

And EthicHub was the winner of the latter category. So thank you very much to the jury for valuing our proposal and the work performed in these more than 5 years. As our co-founder, Gabriela Chang, pointed out when she received the award, _"Blockchain has a huge potential for social projects. We promote regenerative finance, because the common good does not have to be at odds with the creation of value as a company. I think what is opening up at the moment is the possibility of regenerative finance, business models that were not possible with web2 and I think that in the end all technologies are just tools and it depends on us, on what we want to use them for."_

We are very proud to add to our showcases a new recognition and we are confident that it will not be the last one. The most veteran ethichubbers will remember that, at the end of 2017 at the BitConf held in Colombia -the most important and representative event of the Blockchain ecosystem- we were awarded the Blockchain4Humanity prize for the best Blockchain project in the financial inclusion category. In 2018 we obtained the recognition of the Fintech ecosystem in Spain, with the Spanish Fintech Award for the best startup with social impact. In 2018 also, in the Ibero-American Design Biennial we were the most awarded proposal among the hundreds of projects presented, adding the Design for Development / Spanish Cooperation Award, the Design and Entrepreneurship Award and a special mention in the Service Design category. In 2019, during the Demo Day organized by Ship2B -a benchmark entity in the world of impact investment in Spain- we were awarded the prize for the Highest Impact project. And shortly thereafter, Ship2B awarded us its Impact Company seal, officially accrediting us as a Social Enterprise. Also at the end of this year, we were awarded the prize for the Best Social Impact Project 2019 granted by AIBC Malta Blockchain & IA Summit, an international event that brings together thousands of people from around the world interested in the development of disruptive technologies. In December of this same year, we were the winning startup of IV edition of the Chivas Venture competition in Spain and selected for the global final. In April 2020, due to the health circumstances caused by COVID19, the organizers decided to share the global prize among the finalists, thus being co-winners of the Chivas Venture Trophy 2020. The years 2021 and 2022 have been a time to reap what we have sown, receiving invitations to participate as speakers in world reference events: Eth Denver, the FLII, Eth Barcelona, Devcon Bogota and WebSummit among others.

We are pleased to add to our achievements the FIA2022 award for the fintech with the greatest impact and sustainability that we received during the Financial Innovation Awards.
