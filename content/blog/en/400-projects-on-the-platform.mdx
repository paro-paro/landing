Thank you very much to all ethichubbers who have participated in any of these projects because hundreds of families have benefited from your interaction in the EthicHub ecosystem.

We would like to share with all of you how excited we are to reach the 400 projects uploaded to the platform. As you can see in the image, it has been the Pavencul community the applicant of such a significant project. Pavencul is a veteran community of the EthicHub ecosystem that has been with us since April 2020 and is led by Gabino Perez, and we will surely continue together in dozens more projects!

We are very happy with all the way we have come since we launched the first of our projects in June 2018. Since then, not only have we reached this significant figure, we have also managed to incorporate more than 21 smallholder communities, spread between Mexico, Brazil and Honduras, into our platform. Hundreds of families have benefited from new financing tools at much cheaper and more accessible rates. On their behalf, we would also like to thank the more than 2,000 ethichubbers who have financed these communities or strengthened the ecosystem by making their ethix available to the compensation system. Thank you all very much!

We continue working to bring our proposal to many more countries and finance more communities and other agroforestry crops, always with the clear purpose of bringing this technology to those who need it most in a collaborative ecosystem where everyone wins with the relationship and mutual collaboration.
