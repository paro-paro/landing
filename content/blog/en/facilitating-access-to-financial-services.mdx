EthicHub's small farmers can now have individualized bank cards to facilitate their operation and reinforce security in the use and disposal of funds.

Following our philosophy of providing a comprehensive service to our farmers, EthicHub has achieved a significant milestone that will significantly facilitate our communities' operations.

With the delivery of individualized bank cards, **we managed to improve the security in the dispersion of money notably, reducing the risks** involved in handling cash and avoiding long journeys from their remote communities to the Bank branches.

_The success comes from afar, and we want to thank our team in Mexico, led by Lucia, for the initiative and effort they have put into this project. "To achieve that, a small producer or a group of them have access to financial services through a_ **_simple bank account_** _was a challenging process. The whole process represented a challenge of organization, administration. Now they have a_ **_debit card to receive the support generated through the EthicHub platform._** _We have supported them to organize themselves through a Society of Rural Producers that they called "Harvesting Wealth." Once it is organized, we accompany them through the long and complicated path of fulfilling all the requirements of creating an organization."_

_Commendable work has allowed all member farmers to have "these financial services at no cost to them." Perseverance finds the reward, and, as Lucía points out, "In the end, they succeeded, and through their own organization they obtained the support of a banking institution to generate individual accounts one by one, giving them a debit card that will allow them to use it freely. They can also deposit or receive payments or supports of any kind and provide it or save it if they prefer to do so. "

At EthicHub, this reality provides us with enormous personal satisfaction. As Lucia recalls, "for farmers in the mountainous areas of Chiapas, it is only a fantasy, to imagine entering a bank and asking to be attended and to be allowed to open a checking account. But we have made their fantasy a reality."  
  
And beyond this personal satisfaction, it is also **an important step for EthicHub** on our journey to scale the model globally. Building this bridge with the traditional financial system will make it much easier for us to **automate the increase in the volume of operations and loans** channeled through our platform before the blockchain ecosystem offers us valid alternatives. An enormous effort by all the actors involved that generates personal benefits that result in the strengthening of the common project.
