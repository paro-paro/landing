We opened a new international market with Old Spike Roastery UK and Change Please, two well known british social projects we share the same vision and purpose with.

We are delighted to share this news with you—EthicHub coffee in the UK. Our partnership with [Old Spike Roastery](https://oldspikeroastery.com/) UK and [Change Please](https://changeplease.org/) inaugurates a new international market this time in collaboration with two social companies doing an admirable job and sharing the same vision.

At EthicHub, we provide cheap and accessible financing to unbanked small coffee farmers' communities, enabling them to open new markets at fairer prices for their crops. at the same time these British social enterprises are changing hundreds of people's lives by doing a commendable job. Among other things, our British friends have rescued homeless people from the streets to change their uncertain future giving them access to a second chance.

Through the opening of academies, they provide quality training for them. After the course, they will be able to work in the coffee industry as a barista or help coffee companies with their product commercialization. This initiative makes a significant impact. We could not have imagined a better partnership, and it is an obvious example of the new economy based on collaboration and mutual benefit.

### **Change Please.**

#### These British social enterprises are changing hundreds of people's lives by doing a commendable job.

As we are very excited for the milestone achieved through this collaboration, EthicHub team has decided to distribute 1000 extra tokens on Monday to all of you who support the project by staking your Ethix directly in our platform or through the exchange platforms such as Balancer or Uniswap.

With the British market, EthicHub adds a new country for you to enjoy our farmers' fine coffees. The list keeps growing and you will be able to buy our specialty coffee in Spain, China, Canada, and the UK. Which country will be next? An impact story: Change Please was the winner of the Chivas Venture 2018 edition, and as you know, EthicHub was one of the co-winners of the 2020 edition.

So under this inspiring umbrella, where dozens of social companies meet, EthicHub was nominated to represent Spain. Chivas Venture is building a strong and impactful community within the social enterprise. This is how we got in contact with Change Please; exchanging experiences, ideas, and passion for creating a better future for everyone. .
