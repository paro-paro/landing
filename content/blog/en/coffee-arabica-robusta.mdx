If you are a newcomer to the exciting coffee world and have recently started to taste new flavors to delight your palate, you will surely have realized that two types of coffees are the best sellers; Arabica and Robusta coffee, but, do you know the differences between both varieties? Do not miss the following article in which you will discover all the secrets of these two black golds.

## Difference between arabica and robusta coffee

[](https://bit.ly/35vp5Pn)Both varieties belong to the same genus _Caffea_ from the _Rubiaceae_ family. This family has more than **80 different species** and a large number of varieties. Among the most common and widely cultivated varieties in the world are _Coffea arabica_ and _Caffea canephora_ (robusta).

[](https://bit.ly/35vp5Pn)The Arabica variety or Arabica coffee owes its name to the Arabian Peninsula. It comes from Ethiopia, being in Yemen, where it was consumed for the first time as we know it today. This variety has a low concentration of caffeine, which makes it a smooth beverage in which its aroma and fineness can be easily distinguished.

[](https://bit.ly/35vp5Pn)In the case of the _canephor_ variety, it is estimated that its appearance dates back to the year 1800 in Central Africa. The caffeine level of this variety is high, which gives it a strong and bitter taste. It is a variety highly appreciated by espresso lovers.

More specifically, the main differences between the two varieties can be summarized as follows:

-   Arabica is considered a more **aromatic, sweet, and smooth** coffee, while Robusta has a much more **bitter** taste**, is richer in caffeine, and has more body.**
-   The beans of the _canephor_ variety have fewer oils, so the espresso's characteristic foam is maintained for a longer period of time. This lack of oils is also responsible for the more bitter taste. On the other hand, Arabica coffee has a much sweeter and fruitier flavor due to the number of natural sugars it contains and the higher oil content of its beans.
-   Arabica is the most cultivated variety in the world. Each coffee has its own aromatic character. The flavor varies depending on the climate, the type of drying that the beans have received, and how they are roasted. Due to its mild flavor, it is the most consumed variety by coffee lovers.
-   The type of bean is another of the differences between these varieties of coffee. The _canephor_ variety **has a round bean shape and a straight central line.** On the other hand, the arabica bean resembles a bean and the central line is curvilinear, similar to the letter "s".[](https://bit.ly/35vp5Pn)

The production of both varieties accounts for 99% of the beans consumed, with **arabica production exceeding that of robusta, accounting for** 60% and 40% of production.

## **Differences in the growth of both varieties**

One of the most distinguishing features of both varieties is the way they are cultivated. **The arabica variety is grown on a high plateau between 800 and 2000 meters, at a high altitude.** To achieve a good production it is necessary to have a temperature between 15 and 25 ºC and it is necessary to have a lot of shade so that it retains its humidity. As a general rule, this variety flowers after a rainy season. The soil should be rich in minerals and essential elements.

[](https://bit.ly/35vp5Pn)The tree from which robusta originates can grow up to 10 meters tall and is able to withstand extreme climatic conditions and pests. It is grown in low-lying areas, specifically from sea level to 800 meters above sea level. **The ideal temperature is between 24 and 30 ºC** and it needs direct sunlight. The tree flowers irregularly and the fruit appears after ten or eleven months.

## **Arabica and Robusta coffee varieties**

Within the Arabica coffee bean different types of coffee can be found:

-   **Mocha.** The bean of this variety is characterized by its low acidity and a flavor that evokes the taste of chocolate.
-   Java. It is, after the mocha variety, the most popular. It has a strong and somewhat spicy flavor, although sweet notes can be distinguished in the background.
-   **Kenya AA:** This variety is characterized by a much more intense flavor, with notes of berries and a certain acid touch.
-   **Tarrazú.** Its flavor has a touch of chocolate and aged wood, giving it a good body.
-   **Peaberry.** This variety has a sweet aroma with floral and citrus notes.
-   **Sierra Nevada de Santa Maria.** The name of this variety is the name of the largest natural park in Colombia. It has acid and bitter touch that combines with a caramelized flavor reminiscent of toasted bread.
-   **Harrar.** Its name comes from the place where it is harvested, dried, and roasted in Ethiopia's Harrar region. It is a grain with high acidity and a fruity aroma.
-   **Yirgacheffe.** It has a sweet and dense flavor in which hints of fruit can be distinguished.
-   **Mandheling and Lintong.** It has an aroma of forest herbs that can cause a decrease in its quality.
-   **Taroja Kalossi.** It comes from the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. It has a good body and a well-balanced acidity level.
-   **Blue Mountain**. It is one of the most delicate varieties and one of the most appreciated by coffee lovers. It comes from Jamaica and has an intense aroma and a mild acidity.

In the case of robusta, hybrid varieties are difficult to identify. In general, they can be grouped into two varieties: _Ereccta_ and _Nganda_ which differ in the shape of the tree from which they originate.

## **What is better, coffee beans or ground coffee?**

When you decide to buy a good coffee in the market, you will find different varieties, as we have previously mentioned, but there is also another variable: coffee beans or ground coffee? **Surely you have asked yourself what is better on more than one occasion, to opt for a variety already ground or to buy the beans to grind them at home.** We will try to answer this question.

Coffee beans conserve their natural form and have not been ground before being sold. From an economic point of view, it is an intermediate option, since it is cheaper than coffee sold in capsules, but it is more expensive than ground coffee. The main disadvantage of buying the beans is that to enjoy the liquid gold we need to invest more time, it is necessary to grind them before putting them in the coffee pot.

On the other hand, ground coffee is the most appreciated by coffee consumers due to its practicality. It is unnecessary to grind before introducing the product into the coffee maker, thus saving time in the preparation process.

Choosing between one format or the other is not simple, both options are good as long as good quality varieties are chosen. When choosing between ground coffee or coffee beans, the first thing to keep in mind is the time we have available. If we do not have much time to enjoy a good cup of this unique elixir, it is best to opt for the ground format that does not require previous preparation. If you have more time, it is more convenient to opt for the bean format since in this way the beverage is prepared with the raw material in its original state and, as indicated by the coffee experts, a better coffee is obtained.

## **Importance of roasting level**

The flavor and quality of a good coffee are influenced by numerous factors such as the variety, the origin, the type of collection, how it is dried, and the type of roasting to which it is subjected. Roasting is the process by which the product passes from its natural state to a brown-colored product, the typical one that we see in the stores.

In general, this process is carried out through the use of roasters that increase the temperature while the product moves inside. **From 180 degrees, intense aromas begin to emerge, acquiring a caramel color, and from 215 degrees a brown color is achieved.** Subsequently, the beans are cooled abruptly to fix the aroma and prevent losing their natural oils.

## Different types of roasts can be summarized as follows:

-   Light roast or cinnamon. It results in a cinnamon-colored product. In this process, the original flavors are preserved, so it is the one used for _gourmet_ products. It is the best roast for filter coffee makers.
-   Medium roast. This roast still maintains a considerable level of caffeine, but a higher sweetness. Due to the greater exposure to heat, the sugars caramelize and caramel, nuts, or chocolate nuances are achieved. It is an ideal roast for espresso and filter coffees.
-   Dark roasting. In this process, the product is much drier and all its essential oils are extracted. The caffeine content is very low and this is the type of coffee used mainly in espresso machines. Spicy and smoky flavors are achieved with this roast.
-   Roasted. It is not strictly speaking a roasting level. It is the result of adding sugar to the roasting process. In this way, the appearance of the beans is brighter and their flavor is stronger.
