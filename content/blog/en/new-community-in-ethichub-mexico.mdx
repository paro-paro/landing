We present to you the community of San José Ixtepec that will now be able to enjoy new financing tools that are much cheaper and more accessible. Thanks to all Ethichubbers.

This town is located in the municipality of Motozintla, Chiapas, at an altitude of 1908 meters above sea level. It has 653 inhabitants, and its plots are located at higher altitudes reaching 2000 meters above sea level. San José Ixtepec becomes EthicHub's 22nd community.  
  
For generations, the inhabitants of this community have been dedicated mainly to the cultivation of Arabica coffee, although they also grow other crops such as potatoes, corn, and fruit trees. The local conditions and altitude have made the quality of the coffee they produce to be magnificent.  
  
Now, there is a good road, which means that traveling to the ejido is no longer a limitation. However, the humid conditions, due to the altitude of the area, and the magnificent fog that descends in the middle of the day, make the drying process of the coffee slower.  
  
In addition to this problem, the need to pay for the work without having credit available to them causes the coffee to be sold either wet or in grapes, causing a considerable loss in their coffee harvests.
