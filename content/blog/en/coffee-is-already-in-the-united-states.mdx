_A specialty coffee produced by our smallholder farmers is already available on the American market._ We have excellent news for all of you. We have recently opened a new international market for our farming communities.

Our list of international countries is getting longer. Now you can find the United States among Spain, China, Canada, and the United Kingdom. For the American adventure, we are fortunate to continue to have the support of RWTC, an international reference platform in the export of raw materials. We are grateful for the work and value they provide to let EthicHub expand its borders. We have partnered with [RWTC for previous expansions to China](https://medium.com/ethichub/our-small-farmers-coffee-goes-to-china-11b546cbf833) and Canada.

With the opening of international markets, we are managing to reinforce the comprehensive care that we intend to provide to millions of small communities of unbanked producers. Dysfunction of the traditional financial system makes it impossible for them to get out of the circle of poverty that grips them, despite being hard-working people and having a profitable activity. With the opening of new markets, we achieve direct marketing and eliminate many links of the distribution chain.

### At EthicHub, we strongly believe that there is a new way of doing things and that collaboration and mutual benefit must be the engine of the future economy.

And you can also grab a bag of our excellent coffee in our [online store](https://cryptocafe.madrid/en/collections/todos-los-cafes-de-especialidad). 50% of the net profit from your purchases goes directly to EthicHub farmers because we want to value what is usually the weakest link in the distribution chain. At EthicHub, we strongly believe that there is a new way of doing things and that collaboration and mutual benefit must be the engine of the future economy.

And finally, our recurring tribute to all the ethichubbers who are making all of this possible. To celebrate this important milestone with all of you, we will distribute an extra 1000 Ethix among all the Ethixholders that are part of our impact token ecosystem. Stay tuned to our social media platforms

Rarely does a cup of coffee leave a better taste in your mouth!
