Next Monday, June 5th, it will be available for all of you to become EthicHub investors and contribute to scale our value proposition together.  
  
We are in luck, ethichubbers. The news that [we anticipated on February 3rd, in the coffee with ethichubbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlGYbkfkKjE), is about to materialize. We just have to wait a little bit longer, but you can already book your participation.  
  
As you can read in the conditions listed on the Token City platform ([Adventurees Token City Launcher](https://www.token-city.com/investinethichub)), the minimum investment ticket is set at €1,527 and participants will also receive one #ethix token for each euro invested. As the total amount of the financing round has been set at €200,000, in equity loans with the option to convert into equity of the company, there will be a maximum of 131 investment tickets. The pre-money valuation of the company is set at $7 million.  
  
We are very happy to announce this new milestone because we believe that with the work done in all this time, and the achievements of these five years, it is time to grow and scale our model. And we want to do it with you. As Gabriela Chang, our co-founder, says, "for some time now, our community has been interested in investing in us, in the team, in the project, beyond the loans made to small producers". And now you have the opportunity. We would very much like to count on all of you who have not been with us in recent years, because the best is yet to come.  
  
But beyond you, the most veteran ehtichubbers, we also want to incorporate into our ecosystem as many new ones that until now remained somewhat hesitant for various reasons. With Token City we have found a very valid vehicle to articulate our proposal and facilitate your investment, regardless of your profile or possibilities.  
  
The joy of all of us is very well captured in this comment from our other co-founder, Jori Armbruster, "I am very happy to announce the launch of a crowdequity round with Token City. We have been wanting to do a crowdequity round for years to give our community a stake in the project and Token City is the best possible partner as we have been friends for years in the Cryptoplaza ecosystem and we both have a shared mission to democratize the financial system."  
  
And little more from us. Next June 5th is an important day for all of us and we would like you to be part of it too. If you have any doubts or questions, you can write to us at support@ethichub.com or share them via Telegram if they are not private.
