Last Thursday, January 23, **our new credit line protocol was inaugurated** to operate with EthicHub Credit [Originators.](https://www.ethichub.com/en/originators)

## **What’s new in EthicHub 2.0?**

As we have been explaining throughout 2024, the new EthicHub 2.0 version has evolved from a multiple focus on Originator projects with dedicated investors, to an approach in which investors choose which Originator they want to support, **by contributing Ethix to their crowd collateral**, while the loan with stable cryptocurrencies is now pooled in a common fund to be accessed through the lines of credit authorized to the Originators as a new mechanism **to disperse the funds to the cooperatives.**

This new protocol has been audited by **Red4Sec** and has been deployed on the **Celo blockchain**, where we are also slowly migrating EthicHub 1.0 users.

## **Reserva 1920: The first beneficiary of this line of credit**

**The first beneficiary** of a line of credit has been the [**Reserva 1920**](https://www.ethichub.com/en/originators/reserva-1920) cooperative, member of La Tribu cooperative association based **in the Jaltenango area in Chiapas**, Mexico, a region well known for the quality of its coffee.

For now, they have received USD $106,000 on account of the project to purchase the first container in 2025.

We started working with coffee from La Tribu in 2024 and **it has been very well received** by our roasting customers. Like all EthicHub coffees, it is a specialty coffee, from **small producers and agroforestry crops.**

The ID of this line of credit is 0.

## **Boosting coffee purchase projects to minimize risks and maximize impact**

We want to promote more coffee purchasing projects like this one, since this way we minimize the risk (the good price encourages them to deliver coffee to settle the debt), **optimizing the economic model** by integrating the commercial margin and **maximizing the impact** because there is even more value in a good price than in an affordable credit. The cooperative will end its responsibility on the line of credit when it delivers the coffee and EthicHub will amortize the rest of the line when it sells and collects the payment for the coffee.
