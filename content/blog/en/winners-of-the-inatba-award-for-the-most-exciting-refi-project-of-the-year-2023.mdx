**The International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications -INATBA has awarded us as the "Most Exciting Regenerative Finance Project" of the current year.**

Congratulations ethichubbers, our work has once again been recognized and awarded!

This time, the award has been given by an international association, integrated by relevant actors of the Blockchain industry. In INATBA we can find large consolidated companies and other new ones, born under the protection of Blockchain technology. Also representatives of civil society or members versed in political and regulatory issues. More than 170 members in 32 countries. And it is in this context of international collaboration that our proposal to use technology to apply it to the real and productive economy and benefit those who need it most, has been highlighted.

We are very grateful for the recognition because INATBA's objective is none other than to try to take advantage of all the transformation potential and benefits of DLT and blockchain technologies. And in that same purpose we are committed here, in generating collaborative ecosystems, where all actors win with the relationship and mutual collaboration, demonstrating that it is now possible to "do things differently". And you who are reading these lines are making it possible. So this award is for the whole EthicHub community.

The awards gala, which took place in Brussels on January 31st, was divided into 6 different categories; DeFi, ReFi, Social Impact, Education and Corporate Innovation. We were nominated in the ReFi category with three other great projects such as IotaOrigin, Flowcarbon and Celo Blockchain. We were especially excited to share nomination with our friends from CELO where our value proposition is present since the summer of last year and where we have found a common home where we are very comfortable.

We assume this award as the previous ones, as a motivation to continue with our value proposition and with the responsibility to live up to the illusion and expectations that revolves around EthicHub.

Thank you!
