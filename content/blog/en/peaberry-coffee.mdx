For many, coffee is more than a drink: it is the daily ritual to start a day with positive energy and the best aroma.

Different varieties of Arabica coffee are characterized by their size, density, particular organoleptic properties (terroir, aroma, fragrance, flavor, body, acidity, etc.).

The quality of coffee is defined by how the plants are cared for, the land where they grow that gives it characteristics (terroir), and the care is taken when cutting only the fruits that have reached the optimum point of maturity. **The maturity of the fruit usually is recognized by the burgundy red color of its bright fruits.**

Next, come the washing and drying processes (wet-milling), where the optimum fermentation point must be given to continue with the pulping and washing of the grains already free of skin and mucilage.

Small producers do this process manually in small batches that they spread out in the sun until they achieve the percentage of humidity required to continue with the dry beneficiation process with specialized machinery. **The grains are classified by density and size.**

## What is Peaberry coffee?

In addition to the characteristics of each variety, it can happen what we might call a morphological "accident" of the coffee bean, when instead of developing two cotyledons (halves) within each fruit, only one seed (cotyledon) is generated when filling the space of the missing half, and it has rounded shape by which it is known as **Peaberry.**

**This physical modification does not significantly alter organoleptic properties despite being proportionally smaller than standard ones.**

The smaller grains are separated during the size sorting process and then sorted again with a screen or mesh called Peaberry.

## Why is it special?

Its peculiar **rounded shape** makes it unique and visually differentiates it from "normal" grains that have a flat face. Traditionally they were roasted for their own consumption. Their spherical shape facilitates manual roasting since they easily roll on the hot surface of pans or griddles placed directly on the fire. In this way, coffee farmers obtained more standard toasting either by turning them by moving the pan by the handle or by moving them continuously with a shovel.

**The low production volume of the** [**Peaberries**](https://shop.ethichub.com/products/cafe-peaberry-caracolillo?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=peaberry_blog) **limited their consumption to coffee lovers from the localities in the producing countries.** The quality of the Peaberries is directly linked to the quality of the batch of coffee from which they were separated.

Thanks to EthicHub's nano lot logistics, today, it is possible to import small quantities of these peculiar beans for the enjoyment of connoisseurs. By using professional machinery, our master roaster can achieve that extra point of perfection.

## What percentage of the coffee is Peaberry?

Its scarcity also adds a point to the exoticness of its form: only a small proportion of each harvest will produce Peaberries (between 2% and 8%) randomly. It will usually depend on the state and age of the coffee plants since they tend to form in their crowns and areas with less woody branches.

## Why Peaberry is not as common as Arabica coffee?

It is little known due to its scarcity. It was originally considered a defect in arabica coffee that had to be eliminated during quality control. Its different shape and density made roasting irregular (they absorb more heat and roast before the other beans)

## Does Peaberry have more caffeine than Arabica?

Although the slower formation of this grain gives it greater density and body, the caffeine content is similar to that of the variety to which it belongs. In general, Arabica coffee varieties have less than half the caffeine of less noble varieties (Robustas) and are distinguished by their **great nuances of sweet and fruity flavors.**

## Why you should try our Peaberry coffee?

Because they are a rarity, only a very small percentage of the world's coffee production. And also, because the Peaberries are grown sustainably under the shade of trees by the expert hands of small farmers in one of the regions with the greatest biodiversity on the planet (Hot spots), we are talking about a unique coffee ; that is worth trying!
