#### And this magnificent announcement is accompanied by another as predictable as it is exciting. Cooperativa Sierra Azul will be the first Originator Hub of the promising collaboration agreement we have with Heifer Impact Capital (HIC), Heifer Labs and Heifer Mexico.

This is excellent news that we are announcing today.

The most veteran ethichubbers will remember how not long ago, in June of this year, we also shared with you here the immense joy we felt when incorporating Heifer to our ecosystem. A very relevant and internationally recognized player. A partner with whom we share interests and objectives from humility. Not in vain, in its almost 80 years of life, the NGO Heifer International has served more than 40 million farmers and local producers around the world. And that is why we are so happy and excited about this partnership. Because we are gradually intensifying our joint collaboration to explore together the immense possibilities of technology. And at this point it is worth remembering what Jorge Barrigh, Heifer Impact Capital's regional director for the Americas said with the announcement of the collaboration agreement, "the investment with EthicHub's platform will allow us to address specific challenges and obstacles present in delivering efficient and streamlined capital to small producers in the last mile, in rural areas of Latin America".

Those of you who are more experienced will also remember the pilot we launched in March of this year with Anepaan O' Deput, a cooperative from Heifer's environment located in Chiapas. They were our third Originator Hub in Mexico. Following the protocol, first we all contributed the necessary Collective Collateral -in ethix- to later be able to finance their projects on the platform. And from these positive experiences, of very limited pilots, we learn a lot. We all learn a lot.

So at this point the usual thanks to all of you. Regardless of whether you have managed to contribute Collective Collateral or fund a project. To this Originator Hub or another. It doesn't matter. In this ecosystem each individual action favors the whole and we can all contribute value according to our possibilities.

Sierra Azul coffee farmer in the fields

**About Sierra Azul**

Sierra Azul is a cooperative that is dedicated to the production and marketing of specialty coffees and that stands out for the technical assistance it provides to its members. Founded in 2010 by a group of young people, sons of producers, determined to organize and commercialize the coffee of small coffee growers in order to have greater viability and better access to markets, financing and social projects from the production and commercialization of coffee. Currently they group 265 producers located in more than 30 communities in different municipalities. Some of these are Capitán Luis Ángel Vidal, Siltepec, Ángel Albino Corzo, Montecristo de Guerrero, La Concordia and Villa Corzo. Another relevant fact is that all the communities are located in the buffer zone of the El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, a protected area that preserves one of the richest ecosystems in Mexico in terms of biodiversity. For this reason, each of the producer's plots is certified organic and has good conservation practices that contribute to the care of the environment and of the flora and fauna of the El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve.

Welcome to all of you!
